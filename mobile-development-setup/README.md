# Mobile Development Setup

## Tools Installed
- Node.js LTS
- VS Code
- Expo Go (Android / iOS)

## Expo Go Setup
1. Visited https://expo.dev/go
2. Installed Expo Go from Play Store / App Store
3. Logged in using Expo account

## Challenges Faced
- Initial QR scan delay (resolved by using same Wi-Fi)
- Firewall blocked Metro bundler (fixed by allowing port 19000)

## Conclusion
Expo Go allows real device testing without emulators.
